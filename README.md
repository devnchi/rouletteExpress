# rouletteExpress
made by House Cass + Sam + Raymond.

In this roulette project, a casino employee logs in to see the current ledger of the
casino balance with the aim to place the best bet for the house. The backend also is tracking wins and losses and  whether or not the casino had money or not for each round.



## How It's Made:
## Tech Used: HTML , CSS, JS, Node, MongoDB, Express
The project had a layout built using HTML/CSS with JS and Node/MongoDB on the backend.
Bets & Results stored on a Mongo database and the retrieval uses Node.js

## Lessons Learned
This project allowed me to test the ability of entering form info into a
database and retrieving it to display on the DOM.
